Planning a 4k or 8k for revision 2025. 

23/02/2025

Opening scene sketched. Seems good enough.
4k boundary already crossed. Gosh.

25/02/2025

Part 2 with an elevate-esque landscape.
I'm strangely satisfied with the 4klang music.
Doing a spaceship.

26/02/2025
More cameras on spaceship.
Playing with a new transition, with poor results.
Compresses down to 5654 bytes.

Why not a good flare in the spaceship scene?

Integrated the flare, p2 scene looks better with that light haze.

28/02/2025
It's hard to mantain momentum.
Hexa fade.

01/03/2025
Even more hard.
We're at 6.2k, and a ship appears below the godrays.

02/03/2025
"finished" the music. 6.7k.
